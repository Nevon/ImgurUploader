README

This is a simple script to upload one or more image files to
http://imgur.com/. If you try to upload an image file or any other type
of file that is not permitted, the script will simply skip them.

INSTALLATION
To install, simply run the install script.

UNINSTALLATION
To uninstall, just run the uninstall script.

USAGE
Usage is incredibly simple. Just select the image(s) you want to upload,
right-click and go to scripts -> Upload to Imgur. Once the images have
been uploaded the URL(s) will be on your clipboard, so just paste them
wherever you want. If you have uploaded more than one URL, they are 
newline delimited.
